                    Though the public transportation system is one of the most cost-effective and sustainable transportation options today, many students hold a negative view of the system due to various factors, including lack of reliability regarding bus arrival times, as well as the absence of personal space. This cynical outlook has translated into students distrusting and disregarding the public transportation system as a reliable option in any situation.

                    <br>
                    Our resulting intervention addresses the most common pain-points we discovered through our research, incorporating them all into an app extension that existing transportation apps can incorporate, so to prevent the introduction of yet another transportation app into the midst of the millions of apps that already exist.

                    02 Research Findings –
                </h1>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>The most common pain-points we discovered amongst the students included <span class="bold-span">the inaccuracy of realtime data + the discomfort from a packed bus.</span> Surprisingly, we also found there to be <span class="bold-span">a desire of having in-person conversations on the bus itself.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Key points we found in our research were how students have little trust in the bus system, due to unmet expectation over time. We found students much more likely to recall a negative experience they have had on the bus as opposed to a positive one.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    As we unpacked our stakeholders’ responses, we discovered underlying <span class="bold-span">value systems that come into play and clash when having to choose a transportation method:</span>

                    <br>
                    Moments where students make an ill-informed decision in a transportation method are a result from <span class="bold-span">decision fatigue</span> or <span class="bold-span">the inaccuracy of realtime data.</span></p>

                </h1>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>Rather than unrealistically trying to force students to choose public transportation in every scenario, our team sought to counteract the strong stigma against public transit by addressing the most common pain-points. The goal was to allow students to see the viability in public transit so that their stigma would not get in the way of making the best transportation decision for their situation. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold-span">Humanizing the Bus Driver:</span> By giving a profile picture and some other information about the bus driver, much like Uber/Lyft profiles, it will allow the riders to feel more comfortable going on the bus now that the person driving the bus is more humanized and approachable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold-span">Bus Rewards:</span> With the number of miles a user has ridden, there will be an opportunity to unlock thresholds and achieve a higher rider status/gain different rewards for different local businesses. This will provide incentives for app users to take advantage of public transportation and encourage people to further explore the city, while also bringing profit to businesses in the area.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="bold-span">Real Time Rider Data:</span> There will be a bus sensor on each bus that tracks the amount of riders that are on the bus. That data will be sent to the app, where it will update people waiting for the bus if that specific bus is likely to pass them or not. This is helpful during rush hour and other times where you are unsure/not expecting the bus to pass by you when you are trying to get to your destination, minimizing frustration.</p>

              <div class="right">
                  <p>The idea of mobility for service was our team’s motto. The future as we see it, is <span class="bold-span">to have transportation methods working in tandem to better service people.</span> We hope that this intervention is a step forward in servicing that idea.

                  <br>
                  There are always going to be some moments where public transportation will be simply inconvenient. This app extension is not about forcing users to choose the bus in every situation, but about allowing public transportation to be on a level playing field with all the other transportation methods. It is about providing users with the information they need to make the best transportation decision in their situation, reducing their decision fatigue, and overall, leading to a more positive bus experience.
