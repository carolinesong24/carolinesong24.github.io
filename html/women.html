                    <p>The threat of limiting/illegalizing resources regarding reproductive rights has not gone away, but has only gotten stronger during these past years. All women must have the right to make decisions regarding their own body, and for that to happen, <span class="bold-span">women must be the ones to lead the conversation in the political field.</span>  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In response to this issue, I created a digital narrative emphasizing the principle of typography and its relationship with visual imagery.

               <p>
                My narrative allows the typography to be unveiled through many layers in a single screen. They allow the user to learn factual information that either supports or contradicts the primary text. Some layers are for the user to simply dive deeper into a specific storyline. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I created illustrations that derive from the political cartoon feeling to support what is being said in the text. Starting off with a seemingly normal looking Capitol Building, users will find that as you interact with the piece, all is not what it seems.

                After a while, a yellow button will appear at the bottom of the screen. When users click, it will take them to a final page with a message for them to takeaway from this experience.

                </h1>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>The overwhelming majority of those who sit on the seats of Congress are white, older males. And as a result, when it comes to decisions made about women and their bodies, women’s voices are often drowned out, their stories being lost amongst the sea of male politicians with different agendas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Of course, not all men are fighting to decrease women’s access to healthcare, and those who are, include other women as well. But the statement remains: everyone deserves to make their own decisions about their own body. Anything less is a violation of our fundamental rights.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>Researching and sourcing ~250 words from various articles from Rolling Stone and Mother Jones, I put together a typographic piece that sends my message clearly to the audience.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>Starting off with a red and black interaction, I found that I did not want information to be screaming at the users. I took a step back to allow the text to speak for itself plainly, in a calm, yet powerful manner.</p>

                    <div class="empty"></div>
                    <p>For my final visual style, I chose to reveal information and images in layers to metaphorically represent <span class="bold-span">the need for us to not take information at face value.</span> As we look at those in Congress, sometimes what various politicians will say will be factually correct. But other times, they will not. And it is up to us not to be tricked by incorrect information, but to do our own research in order to tackle this fight for reproductive rights with both strength and conviction.</p>

                    Final Thoughts –
                </h1>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>One of the foundations of any good communication design piece is typography. The focus during this project was learning how to translate and treat type in the digital space, as opposed to the physical. What are the affordances that come out of digital interactions? What are the limitations? These are all questions that I kept in mind throughout my process, and is what I believe made my design stronger in the end.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Thinking about what next steps I would take for this narrative piece, I would choose to optimize the design further, by testing the interactivity out on multiple users. By gauging their experience, and noting the places that users stumbled, I would want to improve upon the design.</p>
